"""
To start, we will generate a random integer between 1 and 20, and 
based on the result of the random number, we check to see
if it falls under a certain range
if the number is greater than > 15, then the result will be "Cherries"
otherwise if the number is > 10, then the result will be "orange"
otherwise if the number is > 5, then result will be "plum"
otherwise if the number is > 2, then the result will be "melon"
otherwise if the number is > 1, then the result will be "bell"
if the number is not any of the above, then the result will be "bar"

we iterate over using a loop three times and print the results to the user.
as an example "plum cherries"
